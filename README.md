# inaugural-meeting
This repository contains the requirements.txt for the presentation to be given at the first meeting of the meetup. 

To those attending this meetup it is highly recommended that you have Python 3 installed on your machine. All source code for the presentation will be in Python 3. If you have Python 3 with pip installed download the requirements.txt file and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

It is also highly recommended that you make use of virtualenvs. See this guide http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/ for help if you are new to Python and want information on how to get started using them. 

Thanks and I hope to see you at the meetup.
